    "description": "A research team is building a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic MNIST images. The team wants the program to allow users to configure key hyperparameters for the Generator dynamically.\nRequirements:\nUse the MNIST dataset with images normalized to [-1, 1].\nThe Generator should take a 100-dimensional noise vector and output a 28×28 image. Include BatchNorm in hidden layers and ReLU activations.\nThe Discriminator should take an image as input, flatten it, and output a probability of being real. Include LeakyReLU activations.\nUse Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) loss.\nOptimizers:\nGenerator: Adam with learning rate and betas (beta1, beta2) provided by the user at runtime.\nDiscriminator: RMSprop with a fixed learning rate.\nTrain the GAN for 2 epochs with a batch size of 64.\nPrint the Generator loss (G Loss) and Discriminator loss (D Loss) at each logging step and after training.\nTask:\nWrite a Python program that implements this GAN and prompts the user to enter the Generator learning rate, beta1, and beta2 before training. Ensure the training loop correctly updates both Generator and Discriminator and prints the final losses.",
