    "description": "Given an image that contains both a dog and a human, process the image so that the faces of the dog and the human are extracted as separate images. Begin by loading the original image, then determine the exact pixel coordinates that define the rectangular regions for each face. Using these coordinates, crop out each face from the image, ensuring that the cropped sections clearly show the intended subject without unnecessary background. Save the resulting cropped faces as separate image files in a suitable format, and finally display both cropped outputs for verification.\r\n",
